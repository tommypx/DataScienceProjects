# Deep learning - CNN


*Problem type:* Classification problem using a deep learning model (CNN)


## General Context
Application of deep learning methods in the field of medical imaging. Chest x-rays are one of the most requested and used exams by
healthcare professionals, to assess the presence of thoracic diseases, due to its low-cost and
non-invasive nature [2]. Deep learning can, therefore, be an important tool in this area not only
by providing a second opinion as a way of validating diagnostic interpretation by humans but
also as an attractive way to increase the productivity and efficiency in the interpretation
allowing clinicians to better manage their time and resources. Several studies comparing
human and deep learning already point to equivalent performance of both in diagnostic
performance [3].
The dataset used on this project was downloaded from Kaggle. A multi-label deep learning model with a single-label multiclass
outcome has been created: normal status, viral pneumonia, or bacterial pneumonia.
