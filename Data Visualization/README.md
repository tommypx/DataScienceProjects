# Data Visualization 


*Problem type:* Build a meaningful interactive visualization using Plotly with Dash Software 


## General Context 
The Olympic Games dataset, available in Kaggle, has been selected as the base dataset for the Data Visualisation project. The dataset gathers information about all athletes, and not just medal winners, that participated in all modern Olympic Games, from 1896 until 2016, in both Summer and Winter games. There were considered different scopes, but the final choice was to use a visualization to help understand the Evolution of the Olympic Games, due to the historic perspective inherent to the dataset.


## Project Overview
1. Build a line plot, stacked bar plot, cloropleth map plot and parallel plot.
2. The source code used Plotly library and Dash to build an interactive dashboard, which is available on the following URL https://olympic-evolution.herokuapp.com/
